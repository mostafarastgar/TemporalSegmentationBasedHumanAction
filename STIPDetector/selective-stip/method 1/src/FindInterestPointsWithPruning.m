% @description : This function computes framewise interest points from a
% video of dimension (M X N X T) with pruning operation.
% @params : image_stack, (M X N X T) matrix contains video frames
%           sigma_array, Scales at which interest points are detected.
%           alpha, Pruning parameter.
%           block_dim, Block dimensionality on which the pruning will be
%           applied.
%           bP, gP, Pruning parameter.
%
% @output : corner_points, P X 4 matrix, where P is the number of interest
%           point found in the image_stack and each interest point contains
%           4 values :: [X,Y] coordinate of the interest point, frame
%           number, scale at which it is detected.
